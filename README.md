# PROJECT_02
## India vs the U.S. Population By Year
 
This github repository is my project 2 sumbission for CS40: Computing for the Web at Claremont McKenna College. To review project instructions feel free to click [here.](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_02)

For project 2, I firstly looked at India's population growth from 1960 to 2020 and compared it with the population growth of the United States. As seen in the graph, India's population has been growing a lot more compared to the United States during the given time period. These data were taken from the Content section of jdorfman's github.

## India's GDP per capita (current US$)

After comparing the population growth of India and the U.S. in a a line graph, I created a bar graph to indicate India's GDP per capita from 1960 to 2020. The GDP per capita is indicated in USD($), as it is one of the most commonly recognised currencies across the world. The GDP per capita is calculated in thousands. These data were taken from Kaggle.To access the data click [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nejilee/indian-economy-from-1960-to-2020)
